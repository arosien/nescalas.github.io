Join the NYC, Boston, and Philadelphia Scala meetups in Brooklyn, <b>March 12-14, 2020</b>, to celebrate <b>10 years of NE Scala</b>!

Since 2011, the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia Scala meetups have
hosted this community-driven Scala conference. Because the
Northeast Scala Symposium (NE Scala, to its friends) is
community-driven, <i>you</i> help create it. The NE Scala talks are
proposed by the attendees, who then vote to select which will be given.

### "Digital-only conference" update
<span class="date-subtitle">2020-03-11</span>

**tl;dr:** NE Scala is still on, but <b>it will be online-only</b> ([see our initial announcement for more details](https://twitter.com/nescalas/status/1237485050234617856)).

Due to the ongoing, unprecedented public health crisis, the physical event is canceled, and the conference will be hosted on Zoom and [Slack](#feedback).

[Ticket-holders](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/northeast-scala-symposium-typelevel-summit-2020-tickets-92788556069) will receive a link to a Zoom webinar for days 1 and 2; day 3 (unconference) will happen across 5 Zoom rooms.

We apologize to those who are inconvenienced by this (many of us are in the same boat), but we hope you’ll
still join us on Thursday, Friday and Saturday!  We still have a great lineup of talks, and we’re looking
forward to lively discussions around them.  It isn’t going to be quite the conference that we had planned,
but it will still be a lot of fun for everyone!
